# Whack-A-Prof

A semester-long Whack-A-Mole knockoff.

## Description

Whack-A-Prof is a project for CISC 3140: Design and Implementation of Large-Scale Applications. It is a fast-paced, arcade-style game where players score points by hitting professors and faculty members as they pop out of holes within a time limit. I will be integrating this project into Typescript!
